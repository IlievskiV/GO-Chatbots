class GODQNAgent(DQNAgent):
    """ Class for the Goal-Oriented agents with a DQN-based policy learning.
    
    This class is extending the class AbstractDQNAgent from keras-rl framework.
    This type of DQN agent should learn the policies of a dialogue in a given environment.
    
    One agent action is represented as a dictionary having the exact same structure as the user action, which is:
    
        - `diaact`: the act (intent) of the action
        - `inform_slots`: the set of informed slots
        - `request_slots`: the set of request slots
        - `nl`: the natural language representation of the agent action
    
    The following methods are implemented:
    
        - `forward`
        - `backward`
        - `compile`
        - `load_weights`
        - `save_weights`
        - `layers`
    
    
    # Class members:
    
    From [Agent](#agent) class:
    
        - `processor` (`Processor` instance): See [Processor](#processor) for details.
    
    From `AbstractDQNAgent` class:
    
        - `nb_actions`: the number of all possible actions
        - `memory` (`Memory` instance): the type of buffer the agent will use. For example: SequentialMemory
        - `gamma`: the discount reward factor. Default is 0.99, the agent remembers everything
        - `batch_size`: the number of memories to replay in one training epoch. Default is 32
        - `nb_steps_warmup`: the number of steps needed to warm up and fill the memory replay buffer. Default is 1000
        - `train_interval`: no idea
        - `memory_interval`: no idea
        - `target_model_update`: after how many steps, the target DQN gets updated. Default is 10 000
        - `delta_range`: no idea. Default is None. This variable is deprecated
        - `delta_clip`: no idea. Default is Inf
        - `custom_model_objects`: no idea
    
    From [DQNAgent] class:
    
        - `policy` (`Policy` instance): The policy that the agent follows. Default is None
        - `test_policy` (`Policy` instance): The policy that the agent follows during testing. Default is None
        - `enable_double_dqn`: To enable the Double DQN technique. By default is on
        - `enable_dueling_network`: To enble the Dueling DQN technique. Be default is off
        - `dueling_type`: If the dueling is on, what type of it. The default is average

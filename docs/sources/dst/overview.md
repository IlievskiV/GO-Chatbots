### GOStateTracker

```python
core.dst.state_tracker.GOStateTracker(act_set=None, slot_set=None, max_nb_turns=None)
```


Abstract Base Class of all state trackers in the Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems.

__Class members:__

- history: list of both user and agent actions, such that they are in alternating order
- act_set: the set of all intents used in the dialogue.
- slot_set: the set of all slots used in the dialogue.
- act_set_cardinality: the cardinality of the act set.
- slot_set_cardinality: the cardinality of the slot set.
- current_slots: a dictionary that keeps a running record of which slots are filled 
		(inform slots) and which are requested (request slots)
- state_dim: the dimensionality of the state. It is calculated afterwards.
- max_nb_turns: the maximal number of dialogue turns
